This is the mobile version written in Java for Android. The application uses SQLite for local data storage and TensorFlow Lite for Android for the machine learning component (to compress the size of model's weights). The purpose of having locally stored ML models is so that our app can be used in places where there’s no internet and still be able to detect Malaria. The user will be able to save the patient’s data, such as their name and the generated results.
